      <h1>Monsters</h1>
      <p>
        Monsters are a core part of tabletop role-playing games. They provide challenges,
        shape encounters, and help bring the game world to life. Monsters can range from
        simple creatures to powerful bosses that require teamwork and strategy to defeat.

      <h2>Types of Monsters</h2>
      <p>
        Monsters can be grouped into different categories based on their behavior,
        intelligence, and origin. These categories help the game master balance encounters
        and create varied experiences for players.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Beasts – natural creatures like wolves and giant spiders</li>
        <li>Humanoids – bandits, goblins, and rival factions</li>
        <li>Undead – skeletons, zombies, and necromantic creatures</li>
        <li>Monstrosities – unnatural or mutated beings</li>
        <li>Boss Creatures – powerful enemies designed for major encounters</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Monster Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Each monster behaves differently depending on its intelligence and motivation.
        Some creatures attack on sight, while others may retreat, negotiate, or use
        tactics to gain an advantage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding monster behavior helps players make better decisions during combat
        and role-playing situations, while giving the game master tools to run more
        engaging encounters.
      </p>

      <h2>Using Monsters in Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        Monsters are not only used for combat encounters. They can guard important
        locations, serve as plot devices, or even become recurring characters in a
        campaign.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Random encounters during travel</li>
        <li>Guardians of treasure or key objectives</li>
        <li>Story-driven villains or rivals</li>
        <li>Environmental hazards tied to the world</li>
      </ul>
