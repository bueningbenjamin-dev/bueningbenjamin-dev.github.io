        <h1>About Tabletop Hub</h1>

<p>
Tabletop Hub was created to share creativity, strategy, and storytelling within tabletop role-playing games.
Our goal is to provide helpful resources for players and dungeon masters who want to build immersive worlds.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>
We believe tabletop games are more than just dice and character sheets. They are shared experiences that bring
people together through imagination and collaboration. This site was designed to highlight monsters, characters,
and interactive tools that enhance gameplay.
</p>

<h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>

<p>
This project was built to demonstrate web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
As the site grows, more interactive features and resources may be added to expand its usefulness.
</p>
